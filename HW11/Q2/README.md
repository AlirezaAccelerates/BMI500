"Life_time_immune_case_scenario.py" and "Recurrent epidemic_scenario.py" are the two test scripts to simulate Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 of the paper ( DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2003.11371).
You can clone this repo and run them. The src file contains the essential function for running the test scripts.
HW11 is the jupyter notebook for question #2 of the homework in which all previous scripts are integrated.
