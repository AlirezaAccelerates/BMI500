In a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial the efficacy of a heparinoid in ointment form was assessed in treating superficial thrombophlebitis developing after continuous intravenous infusion. One hundred surgical patients were studied, and clinical examination and the iodine-125-labelled fibrinogen test used to assess the results. The mean time required for the relief of local symptoms and signs and the rate of local decline in radioactivity differed significantly between patients receiving the heparinoid cream and those recieving the placebo.
